        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>"Get the great piquant taste of chicken piccata...in the oven," says Bibi. "Using the oven instead of the stove is more convenient, and it frees you up to tend to the other parts of dinner, like some tasty pasta, and maybe a vegetable or a salad."</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, sliced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in flour and garlic; stir constantly until garlic is fragrant and flour is mixed well, about 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and half-and-half. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until sauce is bubbly and thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, capers, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into 2 cutlets. Place in a single layer in the prepared dish. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the sauce evenly over the chicken and top with lemon slices.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over the casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
