                <li>½ cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish with butter.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in flour and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Pour in half-and-half and milk; whisk until sauce is thickened, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper. Stir in garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and paprika.</li>
                <li>Place 1/2 of the sliced potatoes into the prepared baking dish; top with 3/4 cup ham. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese. Pour in 1/2 of the sauce from the skillet. Repeat layering the remaining potatoes, 3/4 cup ham, 1/4 cup Cheddar, 1/4 cup Monterey Jack, and sauce. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until cheese is golden and sauce is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
            </ol>
